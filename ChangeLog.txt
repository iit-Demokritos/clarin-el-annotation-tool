 * frontend/clarin/templates/modals/detect-open-doc-modal.html: Reworked how
 Annotations are stored. Now, each Annotation has an "annotator_id" field,
 which denotes under which annotator configuration has been created. This will
 hopefully fix the deletion of annotations that happen if you accidentally
 open a different annotator on annotated docuemnts.

 1) Updated various components through "composer update"
 2) Reverted into using CodeMirror facilities for converting between
 offsets/codemirror pos.
 3) Fixed the bug of not been able to annotated at long document ends (a side
 effect of the code to convert between offsets & codemirror pos).
 4) Fixed how marks are added (so as all information to persist after an
 editor refresh()).
 5) Changed text field type for the documents table, from text to mdediumtext.
 6) Annotation visualises is now able to scroll the editor, to show the
 selected annotation.
 7) Reverted to a native scrollbar for the editor (has better scrolling).
 8) Allowed the vertical separator bar to move within a wider range.
 9) Reworked ButtonAnnotator visuals, to match the CoreferenceAnnotator.
