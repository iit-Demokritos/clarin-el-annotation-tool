The **“CLARIN-EL Web-based Annotation Tool”** is a new Web-based annotation tool. Based on an existing annotation
infrastructure offered by the **“Ellogon”** language enginneering platform, this new tool transfers a large part of Ellogon’s features and functionalities to a Web environment, by exploiting the capabilities of cloud computing. The annotation tool is written in JavaScript using the AnguarJS Framework, and the Laravel PHP Framework as its backend.

An installation guide will be added shortly!
